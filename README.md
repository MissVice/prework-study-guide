# Angel's Prework Webpage

## Description

This webpage was solely made for my studying purposes. 
I wanted to prove to myself that I can do this and start a new adventure. 
It solves the problem of having my notes all over the place and can focus them to one area. 
I learned a lot of new languages and processes and I hope to continue to improve.
